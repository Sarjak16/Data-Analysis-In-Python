# Import the numpy package as np, so that you can refer to numpy with np.
# Use np.array() to create a numpy array from baseball. Name this array np_baseball.
# Print out the type of np_baseball to check that you got it right.


# solution:
# Create list baseball
baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]

# Import the numpy package as np
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))


#EXERCISE 2:
# Create a numpy array from height_in. Name this new array np_height_in.
# Print np_height_in.
# Multiply np_height_in with 0.0254 to convert all height measurements from inches to meters. Store the new values in a new array, np_height_m.
# Print out np_height_m and check if the output makes sense.

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array from height_in: np_height_in
np_height_in = np.array(height_in)

# Print out np_height_in
print(np_height_in)

# Convert np_height_in to m: np_height_m
np_height_m = np_height_in * 0.0254

# Print np_height_m
print(np_height_m)

#EXERCISE 3
# Create a numpy array from the weight_lb list with the correct units. Multiply by 0.453592 to go from pounds to kilograms. Store the resulting numpy array as np_weight_kg.
# Use np_height_m and np_weight_kg to calculate the BMI of each player. Use the following equation:
 
# Save the resulting numpy array as bmi.
# Print out bmi.

# height_in and weight_lb are available as regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create array from height_in with metric units: np_height_m
np_height_m = np.array(height_in) * 0.0254

# Create array from weight_lb with metric units: np_weight_kg
np_weight_kg=np.array(weight_lb)*0.453592

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

# Print out bmi
print(bmi)

#EXERCISE 4

# Create a boolean numpy array: the element of the array should be True if the corresponding baseball player's BMI is below 21. You can use the < operator for this. Name the array light.
# Print the array light.
# Print out a numpy array with the BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21. Use light inside square brackets to do a selection on the bmi array.

# height_in and weight_lb are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
np_height_m = np.array(height_in) * 0.0254
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight_lb) * 0.453592
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

# Create the light array
light=bmi<21

# Print out light
print(light)

# Print out BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21
print(bmi[light])
