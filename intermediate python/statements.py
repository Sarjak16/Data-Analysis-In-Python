# IF..................................................................................................................
# Examine the if statement that prints out "looking around in the kitchen." if room equals "kit".
# Write another if statement that prints out "big place!" if area is greater than 15.
# solution:
# Define variables
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

# if statement for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")

# if statement for area
if area>15:
    print("big place!")

#     ELSE........................................
#     Add an else statement to the second control structure so that "pretty small." is printed out if area > 15 evaluates to False.
#solution:
# Define variables
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

# if-else construct for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")

# if-else construct for area
if area > 15 :

# elif....................................................................................
# Add an elif to the second control structure such that "medium size, nice!" is printed out if area is greater than 10.
#solution:
# Define variables

# driving right..........................................................................................................
# Extract the drives_right column as a Pandas Series and store it as dr.
# Use dr, a boolean Series, to subset the cars DataFrame. Store the resulting selection in sel.
# Print sel, and assert that drives_right is True for all observations.
# solution
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Extract drives_right column as Series: dr
dr= cars["drives_right"]

# Use dr to subset cars: sel
sel = cars [dr==True]

# Print sel
print(sel)

# Convert the code to a one-liner that calculates the variable sel as before
# solution:
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Convert code to a one-liner
sel = cars[cars['drives_right']]
# Print sel
print(sel)

# Select the cars_per_cap column from cars as a Pandas Series and store it as cpc.
# Use cpc in combination with a comparison operator and 500. You want to end up with a boolean Series that's True if the corresponding country has a cars_per_cap of more than 500 and False otherwise. Store this boolean Series as many_cars.
# Use many_cars to subset cars, similar to what you did before. Store the result as car_maniac.
# Print out car_maniac to see if you got it right.
#solution:
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Create car_maniac: observations that have a cars_per_cap over 500
cpc = cars['cars_per_cap']
many_cars = cpc > 500
car_maniac = cars[many_cars]
# Print car_maniac
print(car_maniac)
