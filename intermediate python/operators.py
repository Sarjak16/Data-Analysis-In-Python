# In the editor on the right, write code to see if True equals False.
# Write Python code to check if -5 * 15 is not equal to 75.
# Ask Python whether the strings "pyscript" and "PyScript" are equal.
# What happens if you compare booleans and integers? Write code to see if True and 1 are equal.
# Solution:
# Comparison of booleans

True==False

# Comparison of integers
-5*15!=75

# Comparison of strings
"pyscript"=="PyScript"

# Compare a boolean with an integer
True==1

# Write Python expressions, wrapped in a print() function, to check whether:
# x is greater than or equal to -10. x has already been defined for you.
# "test" is less than or equal to y. y has already been defined for you.
# True is greater than False.
#solution:
# Comparison of integers
x = -3 * 6
print(x>=-10)

# Comparison of strings
y = "test"
print("test"<=y)

# Comparison of booleans
print(True>False)
