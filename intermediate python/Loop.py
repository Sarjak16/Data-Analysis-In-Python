#while loop...............................................................................................
The while loop is like a repeated if statement. The code is executed over and over again, as long as the condition is True. Have another look at its recipe.

while condition :
    expression
Can you tell how many printouts the following while loop will do?

x = 1
while x < 4 :
    print(x)
    x = x + 1
    
    answer:
    3
    
#basic while loop
#Create the variable offset with an initial value of 8.
#Code a while loop that keeps running as long as offset is not equal to 0. Inside the while loop:
#Print out the sentence "correcting...".
#Next, decrease the value of offset by 1. You can do this with offset = offset - 1.
#Finally, still within your loop, print out offset so you can see how it changes.
